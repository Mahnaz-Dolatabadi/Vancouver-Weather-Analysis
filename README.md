# Vancouver Weather Data Analysis

This project analyzes the weather data of Vancouver, focusing on temperature trends, precipitation, and basic statistics.

## Data
The data used for this analysis is from the `weatherstats_vancouver_daily.csv` file, which contains daily weather information, including:
- Maximum and minimum temperatures (`temp_max`, `temp_min`)
- Precipitation levels (`precipitation`)
- Wind speeds (`wind_speed`)

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were created using R:

### 1. Temperature Trends

## Summary of Findings
- **Average Max Temperature**: The average maximum temperature during the period analyzed is displayed.
- **Average Min Temperature**: The average minimum temperature is also analyzed.
- **Total Precipitation**: Total precipitation during the period of analysis was calculated.

## How to Reproduce
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`.
3. Place the dataset `weatherstats_vancouver_daily.csv` in the same directory as the R script.
4. Run the `script.R` file to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insight into Vancouver's weather patterns, highlighting temperature trends and precipitation levels over time.
